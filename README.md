• Significant wave height is a key oceanographic metric representing the average height of the highest one-third of waves. While it is commonly estimated from the standard deviation of surface elevation in deep water, this approach becomes less reliable in shallow environments where low-frequency infragravity (IG) waves contribute significantly to total wave energy. <br>
• To improve accuracy, a frequency-domain approach was implemented by applying a Fourier Transform to the demeaned time series, decomposing the signal into distinct frequency components. The energy associated with each frequency was then quantified using the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, allowing separation of the spectrum into high-frequency sea-swell (SS) waves and low-frequency IG waves and enabling computation of band-specific significant wave heights. This method is helpful for detailed understanding of wave dynamics, particularly in environments where multiple wave processes are present simultaneously.<br>
• This approach is particularly relevant for low-lying regions such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands, where sea level rise and wave-driven flooding pose serious risks. Fringing reefs along ocean-facing atolls can dissipate SS wave energy but are often less effective at reducing IG wave energy, which tends to peak near the shoreline and exacerbate flooding. To investigate these dynamics, pressure sensors and current meters were deployed across a fringing reef at Majuro Atoll near the College of the Marshall Islands (CMI). The dataset was analyzed to assess the relative importance and spatial evolution of SS and IG waves at four locations along the reef profile: the outer reef flat (site 2), mid reef flat (site 3), inner reef flat (site 6), and the forereef near the shoreline (site 7).<br>
• The analysis revealed that the outer reef (site 2) experienced the highest sea-swell energy, with amplitudes decreasing progressively across the inner reef due to dissipation from wave breaking and bottom friction. In contrast, infragravity waves exhibited their highest energy levels near the shoreline (site 7), indicating amplification of low-frequency motions driven by nonlinear interactions and shoaling effects. <br>
• Time-domain plots were supplemented with autospectral analysis to evaluate frequency-dependent energy distributions across sites. The autospectra highlighted the frequency shift and attenuation of higher-frequency components as waves traveled shoreward, while infragravity energy became more dominant in the lower-frequency range near the reef’s interior. <br>
• The findings illustrate the spatial variability of wave energy transformation across a reef system, with significant implications for coastal protection, sediment transport, and habitat preservation in nearshore environments.
